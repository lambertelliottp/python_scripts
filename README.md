## Department License Cost Allocator

### Overview
`department_license_cost_allocator.py` is a Python script that calculates the cost allocation of Microsoft licenses across different departments based on user assignments. It takes two CSV files as input:

- **Users CSV** – Contains employee names, usernames, assigned licenses, and their department.
- **Invoice CSV** – Lists license types and their total cost from an invoice.

The script computes the **total cost per department** and outputs a CSV file with cost distribution and percentage breakdown.
